Welcome to the sample code repository for the blog: ["The Benefits of Encapsulating the Logging Module in a Custom Class for Large-Scale Projects"](https://binhnguyen97.medium.com/the-benefits-of-encapsulating-the-logging-module-in-a-custom-class-for-large-scale-projects-3434ec18a01f). This repository contains the sample code used in the blog to demonstrate how to use a custom logger class like ZLogger to improve the organization, efficiency, and maintainability of your logging system in a large Python project. We hope that this sample code and the accompanying blog will help you understand the benefits of using a custom logger class and how to implement it in your own application. Please feel free to clone or download the code and use it as a reference for your own projects. Happy coding!
